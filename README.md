# Script-purble-place


Script using Autohotkey, for achievements in purble place. There's 2 achievements in Steam. one for cooking 300 cakes and other for finding the correcty suit in 1st try on hard, so I made a script that presses the buttons all the time, to make it more automatized without needing to grind it. Currently it's setted for 1920x1080 but if your monitor is smaller or bigger than it, just change the values to your currently resolution 

inputs: 
g: gets the coordinates of your monitor, in order to get the exact spot for the mouse to catch. The way to change the values is manually going to the file and modifying it.
r: starts the cake script.
m: starts the outfit guesser one.

how to end: since I didn't make a function to end it, the way I was ending is pressing g, which would pop a prompt at the screen, pausing the script temporaly, then I would go and close at the desktop the program
